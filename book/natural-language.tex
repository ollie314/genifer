\section{Natural language is not essential to AGI}

Our approach is to define a logic that can faithfully render arbitrary natural-language texts.  We call such a logical form Geniform.  The translation of NL to Geniform can itself be encoded as logical rules, thus the parsing of NL can be achieved via logical inference (as forward-chaining in a bottom-up manner).  And since logical inference is reversible, the generation of NL will also come as free.

All the irregularities of NL will be taken care of via machine learning.

\subsection{Multiplicity of knowledge representation schemes}

This is how I think of the issue of knowledge representation:\\
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{KR-functors.png}
% \caption{KR functors}
\end{figure}

There are various KR schemes.  For example, in NL, there are various grammar formulations\\
$F$ may be Phrase Structure Grammar.\\
$G$ may be Fluid Construction Grammar.\\
$H$ may be Categorial Grammar.\\
$J$ may be Geniform (a simple grammar I designed for Genifer)\\
$K$ may be Genifer's machine-learned grammar (which may be stochastic and inscrutable to humans)

And then there would be transformations ($\eta, \epsilon, ...$) between the grammatical formalisms.

The problem is whether we can mix multiple KR schemes like $F$ and $G$.  The commonsense KB would be different under either $F$ or $G$, and the entire KB needs to be transformed by some $\eta$.

If we use $F, G, H,...$ at the same time, confusion may arise during machine learning and reasoning.

Perhaps, if we make Genifer be aware of transformations like $\eta, \epsilon, ...$ then maybe it can deal with multiple KR schemes at the same time?  Therefore we maybe don't need to choose or commit to any particular KR scheme at this stage...  in other words, any would be fine.

\subsection{Background: unification-based grammars}

The family of unification-based grammars includes LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar), HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar), and PATR grammar.  The unification algorithm used in unification-based grammar is the same as the unification algorithm used in logic.  This is further evidence that the brain employs abstract symbolic processing similar to formal logic.

\subsection{Background: cognitive linguistics}

Our approach is closer to ``formal semantics''.  Many authors, most famously Richard Montague, have argued that natural languages are formal languages.  Some have also advocated the use of natural language as knowledge representation in AI.  Thus the line between formal and natural languages is blurred.

\section{Abduction as interpretation}
\label{sec:abduction-as-interpretation}

\subsection{A detailed example}

The general sequence is:\\
\hspace*{1cm} tokenization $\rightarrow$ POS-tagging $\rightarrow$ syntax parsing $\rightarrow$ semantic parsing\\
which should be familiar to everyone with experience in NL processing.

I will explain the details using a simple example:\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``I love Mary''

The crucial thing is that we represent everything in a logic-based framework. First we represent the sentence as "raw data" (ignoring tenses to simplify matters):\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{sentence}(e_0)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-I}(e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(e_2)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-Mary}(e_3)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{begins-with}(e_0, e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(e_2, e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(e_3, e_2)$\\
where:\\
\hspace*{1cm} the $e_i$'s are \textbf{entities} (logical constants).\\
\hspace*{1cm} the entities $e_1$, $e_2$, and $e_3$ are words.\\
\hspace*{1cm} follows() means a word follows another word in a sentence.

Up to now, all we have is a sentence as raw text (without meanings).  The next step is to recognize parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc). We can use logical rules to do this.

An example logical rule is:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-Mary}(X) \rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X) \wedge \mbox{noun}(e)$\\
which simply means that the word "Mary" is a noun. X is a variable (implicitly universally quantified). $e$ is a new entity, which instantiates to $e_4$ when the rule is applied.

We can also use logical rules to parse syntax. We can perform ``VP $\leftarrow verb + noun$'' with this rule\footnote{We need this special rule:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(X_1, X_2) \wedge \mbox{parse-as}(X_1, X_3) \wedge \mbox{parse-as}(X_2, X_4) \rightarrow \mbox{follows2}(X_3, X_4)$ }:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{verb}(X_1) \wedge \mbox{noun}(X_2) \wedge \mbox{follows2}(X_2, X_1) \rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X_1, X_2) \wedge vp(e)$\\
which creates a new entity $e_5$ which is a VP.

Assume that eventually we have a parse of the sentence S, $e_6$. Notice that up to now, it's all syntax parsing.

Next we perform semantic parsing.  The key is to generate partial meanings for phrases, such as the verb phrase ``loves Mary''.

\textbf{Lambda operator.}  In formal semantics, it is customary to use the $\lambda$ operator to represent the meaning of phrases.  The reason is that first-order logic do not have the expressive power to represent such phrases.  For example, the VP ``loves Mary'' denotes ``somebody's loving Mary'', which may be represented as $love(\_ \,,mary)$; but that is not a well-formed formula in FOL.  Instead we can represent it using the $\lambda$ expression $\lambda x \; love(x,mary)$.

\textbf{Composition of concepts.}  (For details see \S\ref{sec:composition})  Under this method, all phrases are represented by compositions.  For example, the VP ``loves Mary'' can be represented by $app(loves,mary)$, or in short form $mary \circ loves$.  This composite is a \textit{first-order object}, ie, a first-class citizen in the logic which can be further manipulated or modified, eg, when we compose it with $john$, we get $((mary \circ loves) \circ john)$ which is equivalent to the FOL statement $loves(john,mary)$.

I think this method is superior to $\lambda$ because the meanings of phrases can be represented by first-order objects.  It also makes semantic parsing very intuitive.

\todo{Explain semantic parsing with examples.}

%A semantic rule is similar to a syntactic one:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(X) rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X) \wedge \mbox{verb}(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, \mbox{concept-love})$\\
%
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{verb}(X_1) \wedge \mbox{np}(X_2) \wedge \mbox{follows2}(X_2, X_1) \wedge \mbox{means}(X_1, Y_1) \wedge \mbox{means}(X_2, Y_2)$\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X_1, X_2) \wedge vp(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, comp(Y_1,Y_2))$\\
%
%For example, we can augment the syntactic rule\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP} \leftarrow \mbox{verb}, \mbox{NP} $\\
%with\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP}(\mbox{comp}(Sem_1,Sem_2)) \leftarrow \mbox{verb}(Sem_1), \mbox{NP}(Sem_2)$\\
%where the $Sem$'s are variables containing the ``semantics'' of phrases.\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{S} \leftarrow \mbox{NP}, \mbox{VP} $\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{S}(Predicate) \leftarrow \mbox{NP}(Subject), \mbox{VP}(Subject * Predicate) $\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP}(X) rightarrow \mbox{com}(\mbox{loves},\mbox{mary})$\\
%which creates a new entity $e_7$ with the meaning of "love".\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(X_1) rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{concept}(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, \mbox{concept-love})$\\
%
%The final step of semantic parsing uses a special trick,  ``de-reification'' (\S\ref{sec:reification}):\\
%\hspace*{1cm} (assume that $e_{8}, e_{9}$ denote the persons John and Mary)\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{de-reify}(\mbox{concept-love}, e_{8}, e_{9})$\\
%which generates the logical statement:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{loves}_1(e_{8},e_{9})$\\
%
%Finally we have:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{means}(e_0, \mbox{loves}_1)$

\section{Comprehensive grammatical categories of English}

Here are some NL grammatical categories (intended to cover as broadly as possible) and typical examples in English.  Designers of NL interfaces can supply translations to these examples.  [The contents in this section and all the examples are taken directly from the book "English Grammar" by Peter Collins, 1998, Addison Wesley.  \textbf{NOTE:  This may be a copyright infringement but I have contacted the author without getting his reply.}]  This page is intended to provide a simple comparison of NL interfaces, not meant to be a standard grammar for AGI purposes.

\section{Geniform -- a logical form for natural language}
\label{sec:geniform}

% Rus proposed a popular logical form for rendering natural language, which is of reference value.  Geniform has made several significant improvements over it.

The Geniform logical form is special in that it can represent all natural-language grammatical categories elegantly.  To illustrate this, consider:\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``John loves Mary''\\
which is rendered in predicate logic as:\\
\hspace*{1cm} \formula{loves(john, mary)}\\
(ignoring tense).  But what if we want to say:\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``\textit{Loving Mary} is foolish'' ?\\
The verb phrase ``loving Mary'' is a grammatical unit that has a specific meaning but it cannot be represented in predicate logic.  In computational linguistics we usually use the \textbf{$\lambda$-abstraction} to represent it:\\
\hspace*{1cm} \formula{$\lambda$x.loves(x, mary)}\\
but as you can see, this form is not very human-readable.

The innovation of Geniform is to replace $\lambda$-abstractions with combinators \footnote{As in combinatory logic, a formalism equivalent in expressive power as $\lambda$ calculus.}.  For example,\\
\hspace*{1cm} \formula{loves(x, y)}\\
is represented in \textbf{curried form}\footnote{In honor of the logician Haskell B Curry.}:\\
\hspace*{1cm} \formula{\textbf{loves} = $\lambda$y($\lambda$x.loves(x,y))}\\
so that \formula{\textbf{loves}} is equivalent to the original predicate but it takes its arguments one at a time.

Now we can represent elements like:\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``John loves ....'' as \formula{(\textbf{loves} john)} and\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``.... loves Mary'' as \formula{(\textbf{C loves} mary)}\\
where \formula{\textbf{C}} is a combinator with the property \formula{\textbf{C}XYZ = \textbf{C}XZY}.

( TO-DO:  With the use of combinators, our logic is no longer a first-order logic, but some kind of higher-order logic.  Indeed, the naive form of this logic will be affected by problems like the Liar's Paradox. )

Anyway, Geniform can now express most NL categories.  For example:\\
\hspace*{1cm} chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} wooden chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), wooden(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} a chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), a(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} 3 chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), 3(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} 3 wooden chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), 3(chair$_1$), wooden(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} any chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), any(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} no chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair(chair$_1$), no(chair$_1$)}\\
where \formula{chair$_1$} is an \textbf{instantiation} of the concept ``chair'', ie, a new constant \formula{chair$_1$} is created and ``\formula{chair(chair$_1$)}'' is asserted.  Notice that \formula{chair$_1$} does not denote \textit{one} chair; it is just an instantiation of the abstract concept of ``chair''; additional predicates are needed to specify it.  For example, the application of \formula{a()} or \formula{the()} specifies that \formula{chair$_1$} is singular, and the application of \formula{3()} specifies that \formula{chair$_1$} numbers 3.  It may stretch your understanding a bit to think of ``any chair'' and ``no chair'' as instances of ``chair'', but I think the idea is sound.

Now let's add some syntactic sugar.  The notation \formula{(a \app b)} denotes \textbf{function application} in combinatory logic:  \formula{(a \app b)} is the same as \formula{a(b)}.  The notation \formula{(a -b)} is just syntactic sugar for \formula{(b \app a)}, ie, it expresses function application in a postfix way that makes it look more like English.  So:\\
\hspace*{1cm} the chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(the \app chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(chair$_1$ -s)} $\equiv$ \formula{plural(chair$_1$)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} 3 wooden chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(3 \app wooden \app chair$_1$ -s)}\\
\hspace*{1cm} unexpectedly $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(un \app expect$_1$ -ed -ly)}

We also need some way to differentiate parts of speech, eg:\\
\hspace*{1cm} ``He loves her'' $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{loves:verb(he:pronoun, her:pronoun)}.\\
(In the following examples we will omit such tags.)

If the logic has types, we can use intrinsic types to represent parts-of-speech tags; otherwise we can use predicates to emulate types.  Notice that if we write:\\
\hspace*{1cm} \formula{verb(love)}\\
where \formula{love} is a predicate, \formula{verb} would be a second-order predicate and thus requires higher-order logic.

%In this section, ``sentence'' refers to NL sentences;  ``formula'' refers to logic formulae.

There may be additional problems in rendering NL into logical form:
\begin{compactenum}[\textbullet ]
\item NL notions of ``and'' and ``or'' are not exactly the same as logical $\wedge, \vee$.
\item NL notions of negation are not exactly the same as logical $\neg$.
\item NL notions of "all" and "exists" are not exactly the same as logical $\forall, \exists$.
\end{compactenum}
But I speculate that these minor differences can be mended manually or via machine learning.
