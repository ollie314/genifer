\section{Capitalism, AI, and the Singularity}

Of course, it is impossible to predict things past the Singularity, but my view of the Singularity is more conservative in the sense that I believe human life will remain unchanged in some essential aspects.  My premise is that capitalism will persist after the advent of AI.

\section{My political stance}

As an AGI entrepreneur, I need not be involved in politics, and I have no intention to do so, but some people are frequently trying to politicize the issue to gain an advantage over me, so I am forced to clarify a few things here.

Firstly, I am not anti-American.  My goal is to create a global AGI project without bias towards a particular nationality.  This does not mean that I am advocating to put an end to nationalism.  The internet allows us to work across geographic boundaries, so the conditions are right for this kind of trans-national collaboration.

Secondly, I think open source as a software business model is flawed.  Companies need to protect new ideas to give people incentives to innovate.
