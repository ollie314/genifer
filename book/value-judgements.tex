\section{My stance on AGI friendliness}

I do not have a rigorous theory for AGI friendliness and I'd be very suspicious of any such theory.  But I believe that AGI technology should be made widely available to the general public, because the distribution of power is the best safeguard against abuses of AGI.

Other than that, the AGI should be subject to certain laws that prevent exploitation (eg, unlimited growth or taking up of physical resources).  That would be the job of governments.
