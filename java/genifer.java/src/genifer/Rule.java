  This class is for storing rules in memory.
  Each rule has a Formula plus the following info:
     id
     w            = size of support (ie, total number of times the rule is involved in proofs)
     e+           = positive examples
     e-           = negative examples
     parents      = a list of ancestor rules of this rule
     children     = a list of rules that this rule is ancestor to
