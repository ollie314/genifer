 * Formulas = formulas.  This allows for self-reference, ie, to talk about formulas in formulas.
 * At the top level is the formula (or proposition, or sentence, or logic statement, all synonyms).
 * A formula can be a rule or a fact.  A rule is of the form
     A <- X, Y, Z, ...
   And a fact does not contain the "<-" operator.
 * Each formula consists of a number of literals joined by logical operators (aka connectives) such as AND and OR, and operations can be nested.  Note that NOT is a unary operator.
 *
   The abstract base class of all further Formula classes including constants, functor applications
   and operator applications.
