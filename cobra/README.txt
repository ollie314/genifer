Cobra is on object-oriented language with built-in support for unit testing,
contracts, generics and other high level features.

The Cobra web site has downloads, discussion, wiki, how-to's, samples, etc.

For max run-time speed use "cobra -turbo ..."
although most development should be down *without* -turbo
because it turns off all run-time checks.
