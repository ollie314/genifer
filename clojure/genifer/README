Genifer in Clojure
==================

Genifer is a general inference engine based on a new untyped combinatory logic with fuzzy-probabilistic Bayesian belief propagation.  It can perform deduction (both forward- and backward- chaining), abduction, and inductive learning.

Installation
============

1. The easiest way is to install Leiningen.

2. Then check out the repository to your local directory.

3. Run:
	lein deps

4. Then use one of:
	lein test
	lein test :forward
	lein test :unify
	lein test :backward    (work under progress)
to play around.

{ To-do:  I will provide instructions for running without Leiningen. }

Usage
=====

Feel free to modify the knowledge base to include any fact or rule you want.

{ To-do .... }
